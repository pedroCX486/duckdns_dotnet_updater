# DuckDNS IP Updater

An small .NET Core app to update your IP on DuckDNS.


## What you should know:

- You need to change the "token" string to your DuckDNS token.
- You need to change the "domain" string, you just need to put the domain name (eg. yourdomain not yourdomain.duckdns.org).
- Builds for various platforms/targets can be done using the publish profiles.
